## **Introduction**

__ES/YUSO__ is an online electric charging station search service, which gives you access to all very fast electric charging stations. We offer an interactive map which allows you to find stations around the desired location by following a specified city or by directly browsing the map.

Our service is designed:

- to simplify your search for very fast charging stations, because during a trip, medium or fast charging stations take far too long to recharge (time greater than 2 hours), while very fast charging stations are much more efficient (time less than 45 min)
- to help you find accurate and up-to-date information.
- to make it easier for you to create routes with Google Maps.
